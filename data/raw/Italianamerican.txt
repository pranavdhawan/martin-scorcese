Italianamerican  is a 1974 American documentary film directed by Martin Scorsese and featuring his parents Catherine and Charles, who reflect on their experiences as the children of Italian immigrants to New York City.

Synopsis
Over dinner at their New York apartment on Elizabeth Street, Martin engages his parents in a lively and candid discussion about their lives, discussing such topics as their upbringing, family, religion, marriage, their Italian ancestors, post-war life in Italy, and the hardships of poor Sicilian immigrants striving to succeed in America. Catherine also demonstrates her technique for cooking meatballs, a recipe later printed in the end credits of the film.

Production
Martin Scorsese came up with the idea for Italianamerican after returning from his presentation of Mean Streets at the Cannes Film Festival. A script was written by Larry Cohen in order to receive funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities, but it was not used for the actual film. Six hours of footage was shot, three hours on two days.
Scorsese edited Italianamerican alongside Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.

Reception
Italianamerican was received positively after its screening at the 1974 New York Film Festival, with the New York Daily News reporting the film "completely charmed" the "usually blase festival audience."
